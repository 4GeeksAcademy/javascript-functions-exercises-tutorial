# `07` Functions that return

It's a very good practice that all functions return something, even if it is `null`.

If your functions return something you can then create algorithms that use several functions at the same time. 

In this particular case we have two functions available:

+ `dollarToEuro`: that calculates the value in euros of a given value in dollars.

+ `euroToYen`: calculates the value in yen of a given value in euros.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Using the two functions available, calculate the value of 137 dollars in yen and print it on the console.

## 💡 Hints:

Working backwards:

+ The expected value is in yen. 

+ Our available function `euroToYen` will provide that.

+ To get the euro value, we will use the available function `dollarToEuro`.
