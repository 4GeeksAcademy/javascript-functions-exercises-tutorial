# `08` Functions that return

Is a very good practice that all functions return something, even if it is `null`; if your functions return something you can then create algorithms that use several functions at the same time. 

## 📝 Instructions:

In this particular case we have two functions available:

+ `dollarToEuro`: that calculates the value in euros of a given value in dollars.

+ `euroToYen`: calculates the value in yen of a given value in euros.


1. Using the two functions available, calculate the value of 137 dollars in yen and print it on the console.

## 💡 Hint

Working backwards:

+  our expected value is in yen. 

+ Our available function euroToYen will provide that.

+ To get to euro we will use the available function dollarToEuro.
